The Problem: Relational Atrophy
In Dementia, the ‘Ending’ happens twice: first when the shared history vanishes, and second when the body fails. Between those two points is a “Dead Zone” where caregivers stop connecting and start managing. We are mending the Conversational Bridge to ensure that personhood doesn't “end” before the life does.

The Solution: An Agentic Relational Prosthetic
Suture is a real-time AI ecosystem designed to collapse the friction of caregiving. By harvesting a patient’s “Digital Exhaust”—Gmail archives, Google Photos metadata, and Spotify anchors—we synthesize a Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph of their identity.

Core Features
The Aural Suture: A voice-first agent that whispers real-time conversational "bridges" into a caregiver’s ear to turn confusion into shared memories.

The Identity Compass: A visual HUD that tracks the patient’s current “mental era” and surfaces matching media anchors.

The Ghostwriter: A response-synthesis engine that uses the patient’s past letters and values to suggest comforting answers to repetitive, difficult questions.

The Connection Pulse: A real-time bio-feedback visualization of Relational Synchrony, using Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to measure tonal and rhythmic coupling between speakers.

Technical Architecture
Suture operates on a unified Agentic Loop:

Ingest: VAD → STT pipeline processes environmental audio.

Contextual Retrieval: The system queries the Spatio-Temporal Knowledge Graph to identify the current "Identity Era".

Synthesis: The LLM generates a localized "suture" based on caregiver-defined Narrative Synthesis (milestones, mending style, and safe harbors).

Validation: CRQA analyzes the resulting interaction to visualize resonance on the Connection Pulse.

Onboarding & Privacy
We solve the Consent Gap through a Zero-Knowledge Legacy Protocol. Data is uploaded to build the Knowledge Graph, but access is only triggered via a pre-authorized Relational Key provided by a designated Legacy Trustee.

"Ensure personhood outlasts the memory."
